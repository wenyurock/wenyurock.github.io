	<h1>Gingerbread Cookies</h1>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<img class ="imgRight" src="../images/ingredients.JPG" alt = "A Few Ingredients"/>
			
			</ul>	
				<li>½ cup unsalted butter at room temperature</li> 
				<li>¾ cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
				<li>½ cup fancy molasses</li>
				<li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
				<li>3 ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
				<li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
				<li>½ tsp ground allspice</li>
				<li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
				<li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
				<li>½ tsp salt</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<img class="imgLeft" src="../images/butter-and-sugar.jpg" alt = "Brown sugar and butter."/> 
			<p>Beat the butter, brown sugar and molasses together until light and fluffy.</p> 
			<p>Add the eggs, beating well after each addition.</p>
			<p>In a separate bowl, sift the flour, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</p>
			<p>Add this to the butter mixture and stir until blended.</p>
			<p>Shape the dough into 2 disks, wrap and chill for about an hour up to 2 days (the dough will still be soft, even once chilled).</p>
			<p>Preheat the oven to 350 F and line 2-3 baking trays with parchment paper.</p>
			<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the first disk of dough until just over 1/8-inch thick.</p> 
			<img class="imgRight" src="../images/gingerbread-cutouts.jpg" alt = "Gingerbread Cutouts"/>
			<p>Use a cookie cutter of your choosing to cut out cookie shapes and lift then carefully to the prepared trays, leaving about ½-inch between them.</p> 
			<p>Continue with the second piece of dough – any scraps can be stored chilled and then re-rolled until it has all been used.</p>
			<p>Bake the cookies for 15-18 minutes until you see them brown a little just around the edges.</p> 
			<p>Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the tray before removing to cool completely.</p>
			<p>The cookies will keep for up to 10 days in an airtight container.</p>
